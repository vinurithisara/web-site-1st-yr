        Strict Nature Reserve, which is the home to a variety of wild life, including bears, monkeys and birds. Situated some 10 kilometres 
        South of Nuwara Eliya, the road to Hakgala along the Badulla road is a pleasant downhill drive, mostly through pine forests.

        It boasts of over 10,000 species of flora.

            The main sections of the garden are the rock garden, water garden, fern garden, Japanese garden and the seed room. 
            Hakgala is a temperate hill-country garden, where the lovely low-country lotus and water lily mingles in their serene 
            simplicity with sophisticated English roses, pre-historic looking ferns, and endemic orchids. The intimidating Hakgala
             rock provides an awe-inspiring backdrop to the garden, rising 450 meters over it. According to the legends, the history 
             of Hakgala Gardens dates back to the time of Ramayanaya; an epic love story of the east. Queen Sita, captured and brought 
             to Sri Lanka, is said to have been hidden in this vicinity and the Hakgala Gardens is said to be one of the pleasure gardens 
             of King Ravana called Ashok Vatika. Originally used for the cultivation of cinchona and tea, the present-day Hakgala Gardens 
             was established in 1861 under the patronage of Dr G H W Thawaites. The development of Hakgala Gardens as a botanic garden was 
             initiated by Mr William Nock in 1884 and since then many varieties of flowers and trees, both local and foreign, have been 
             introduced.

            Horton Plains was declared a National Park in 1988 and covers 3160 hectares of grasslands interspersed with forest and forms 
            an undulating plateau more than 2000m (6,600ft) high. The best time to visit these strangely exotic moorlands above Nuwara Eliya 
            is in the early morning.You rise through the wooded countryside on winding lanes. If you are lucky you may get a glimpse of Adam’s Peak in the 
            distance to your right shortly before you reach the open uplands of Horton Plains. Arriving at the entrance gate, you 
            start your walk. The trail is clear throughout, reaching 'Little World's End' in 45 minutes, walking through woodland,
            then 15 minutes later, the greater drop of World’s End. On a clear day, the view is incredible.

                From this point, you can either return to the entrance the same way you came or continue on an open pathway (no more shade) 
                around hillsides until a short climb brings you to the ridge just above Baker’s Falls, where a track leads down to the water. 
                The falls are about 20 metres high, and are worth visiting if you are a keen walker and prepared to do the longer circuit.
                Returning to the entrance gate is along another open path and takes around 45 minutes. The entire walk is around 8 km if you 
                walk to World’s End and back, or around 9 km (5.6 miles) if you do the full circuit.
